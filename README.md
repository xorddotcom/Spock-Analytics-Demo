# Spock Analytics 
Spock Analytics offers an extensive dataset for dApps, enabling dApp creators to identify and analyze critical pain points by combining on & off-chain data points.

<h3> 1. Smart Contract Integration </h3>

<p> Spock provides users with a streamlined and expeditious integration experience. To begin, all you need to do is provide the smart contract details of your dApp. In a matter of hours, Spock will diligently extract, synchronize, and furnish your on-chain data, granting you access to the formidable Understand section. 
 </p>

<h3> 2. Javascript SDK Integration </h3>

<p> You can use the Spock Javascript library to keep track of the off-chain data in your dApp. It's easy to install as an NPM package and will give you valuable insights into how your dApp is performing. 
 </p>
 <br>

a. Install the Spock Analytics published [analytics-web3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/analytics-web3) package from npm.
<br>
b. Integrate sdk on your dApp with the help of [analytics-web3-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/analytics-web3#api) and you can also go through the [demo-code](https://github.com/xorddotcom/DAppzero-Analytics-Demo)
<br>

<h3> 3. Code Adapter </h3>
<p>
Spock adapters are using two approaches for transforming raw on-chain data. One is the transformers which are used to track contribution (USD value moving inside the protocol) and extraction (USD value coming out from protocol), and the other one is TVL extractors that are responsible to calculate the asset in terms of USD locked in a protocol.
